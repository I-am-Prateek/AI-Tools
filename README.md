 => This is a simple website about Artificial Intelligence where we make a group of 3 people
    to write the content and creating different pages individually. This is a group class assignment where
    we learned to work collaboratively using Git Collaboration. First of all I made a Git Repository and invite
    2 other friend in that Repo and we all commited our changes to the website using git commands. 

    #Group Members are: Pratik Shrestha, Aman Basnet and Elvis Tamrakar.

    1) Aman worked on the landing page part where he made a landing page for the website where user visits at first
    2) Elvis worked on the blog page where user can read more information about different kinds of AI news and latest launches
    3) Pratik worked on Tools page where user can find different kinds of useful AI tools like Dora AI, Gamma AI, e.t.c
